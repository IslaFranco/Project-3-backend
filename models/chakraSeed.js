        description: 'Red Jasper is related to the root chakra. This is our first foundational chakra and relates to how safe and secure we feel in the world. When our root chakra is open, we are able to hold our own and to feel grounded no matter what. Red Jasper is also believed to awaken the kundalini serpent which sits at the base of the spine and can lead to big spiritual realizations.',
